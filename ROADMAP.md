# Roadmap âš¡

This page lists all of the patterns that I plan to explain and implement in the future, or the patterns that need some kind of improvement as more examples or better explanation.

Feel free to add an issue with whatever pattern you want to see, or any improvement or suggestion you have in mind.

## Patterns to Be Implemented

### Behavioral Patterns

- [ ] Strategy <!-- TODO: Strategy Pattern -->
- [ ] Mediator <!-- TODO: Mediator Pattern -->

### Resiliency Patterns

- [ ] Circuit Breaker <!-- TODO: Circuit Breaker Pattern -->
- [ ] Bulkhead <!-- TODO: Bulkhead Pattern -->
- [ ] Retry <!-- TODO: Retry Pattern -->

## Examples Structure

Currently, there is a plan to change the examples structure, each example will have its own folder and tests to allow for better separate explanation for the example if needed.

The process of restructuring the examples and test will take time, so some of the patterns will be left for the current time according to the importance of having a separate explanation for the example.
